### 1. Scope and Definitions

These Terms & Conditions (“T&C”) govern the use of the web application “Openclaw” (the “Service”) by consumers.

“Configuration Files” means the Markdown files generated by the Service (currently: SOUL/Constitution, IDENTITY, USER, HEARTBEAT, SHIELD).

“Autonomy Presets” means the preset profiles (e.g., Security, Open, Overclaw) or a custom preset configured by the user.

### 2. The Service (configuration generator only)

Openclaw is a configuration/document generator that produces downloadable Configuration Files based on user selections.

The Service does **not** operate autonomous agents, does not perform actions on the user’s behalf, does not autonomously communicate externally, and has no real-time control over any user system.

The user integrates and runs the Configuration Files in the user’s own agent/automation environment at the user’s sole responsibility.

### 3. Free Service, Advertising

The Service is free of charge and financed through advertising, including Google AdSense or similar services.

Ads may be provided by third parties and delivered automatically. The Provider is not responsible for third-party ad content, offers, or statements.

### 4. No Account; User Responsibility for Storage

The Service can be used without registration and without creating an account.

The Provider does not owe long-term storage, backup, or recovery of user configurations or generated files. Users are responsible for saving and securing downloads.

### 5. Autonomy Levels and Risk Notices

Higher autonomy levels may increase risk of undesired outcomes (e.g., external communications, reputational harm, financial loss, conflicts with third parties).

“Overclaw” may allow autonomous external communication and initiative without prior approval within a scope chosen by the user.

The Service is not intended to enable unlawful conduct, hacking, data exfiltration, or security circumvention. Any “SHIELD” concept may reduce risk but does not guarantee prevention of all misuse or failures.

Users must review risk notices and review the generated files before use, especially for higher autonomy.

### 6. Prohibited Use

Users must not use the Service for unlawful purposes, to infringe third-party rights, to bypass security measures, to distribute malware, or to impair the Service through abusive or excessive automated requests.

### 7. No Legal/Compliance/Security Guarantee

Configuration Files are technical/organizational inputs and may behave differently depending on the user’s environment.

The Provider provides no legal, compliance, tax, or security advice and makes no guarantee that Configuration Files are fit for a particular purpose, error-free, compatible with any system, legally compliant in any jurisdiction, or sufficient to prevent damage or undesired agent behavior.

Users must implement appropriate controls, monitoring, and fail-safes in their own systems.

### 8. Intellectual Property

The Provider retains all rights in the Service. Users may store, edit, and integrate generated Configuration Files into their own systems for their own purposes.

### 9. Availability; Changes

As a free service, uninterrupted availability is not owed. The Provider may modify, restrict, or discontinue the Service for legitimate reasons (e.g., security, abuse prevention, technical development).

### 10. Liability

Liability is unlimited for intent and gross negligence and for injury to life, body, or health.

For slight negligence, the Provider is liable only for breach of essential contractual obligations and limited to foreseeable typical damages.

Otherwise, liability for slight negligence is excluded.

The Provider is not liable for damages arising from the user’s integration, operation, or monitoring of Configuration Files in the user’s own agent system, unless liability applies under Sections 1–2.

Mandatory statutory liability remains unaffected.

### 11. Privacy, Cookies, Consent

Details on data processing, cookies/tracking, and consent for advertising are set out in the Privacy Policy. Where required, consents are collected separately (e.g., via a consent tool).

### 12. Final Provisions

German law applies, excluding the CISG. Mandatory consumer protection rules of the user’s habitual residence remain unaffected.

If any provision is invalid, the remaining provisions remain effective.

**Optional language clause (recommended if you publish DE+EN):**

This English version is for convenience only. In case of discrepancies, the German version shall prevail.
